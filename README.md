# HTML Basics ðŸš€

Welcome to my **HTML Learning Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of basic HTML codes and mini-projects that Iâ€™ve created as I learn and practice HTML.
This repo is not just for personal useâ€”itâ€™s also here to help others starting their Java journey. Feel free to explore and learn!
## ðŸ“š About

This repository serves as my personal learning space where I:

- Explore HTML elements and tags
- Build basic web page structures
- Experiment with forms, tables, media embedding, and more

Itâ€™s a hands-on journal of my journey in web development.
