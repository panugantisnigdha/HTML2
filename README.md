# HTML Basics 🚀

Welcome to my **HTML Learning Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of basic HTML codes and mini-projects that I’ve created as I learn and practice HTML.

## 📚 About

This repository serves as my personal learning space where I:

- Explore HTML elements and tags
- Build basic web page structures
- Experiment with forms, tables, media embedding, and more

It’s a hands-on journal of my journey in web development.
